#FoodTruckProject



Description:
Create an app where a user can input and rate up to five food trucks. Once the input and received, the user has the option to review the info in multiple formats with the information prioritized differently.

Technologies Used:
Eclipse, Terminal , and GitHub

What I Learned:
Null is the devil, but I did learn how to exclude nulls in the end. I also got a better understanding of constructors and toStrings.
